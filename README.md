This program will help the user maintain an inventory of parts. It gets all current inventory data from a file on startup and then provides them with a menu at which they can choose between looking up a part, adding a part, removing a part, receiving a shipment of parts, printing a sales slip, displaying the inventory listing, and quitting.
